- 👀 A polyglot developer with more than 10 years industry experience in Golang, Rust, NodeJs, Ruby, Python, Dart, distributed systems, serverless & cloud technologies (AWS & GCP)
- All the products I build, I ensure they're microservices (golang or nodejs) driven and use Kafka as a queue, deployed using Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Sentry and Jenkins (my favorite technologies in the world).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Apache Airflow, Spark, Cassandra, Hadoop and Flutter.
